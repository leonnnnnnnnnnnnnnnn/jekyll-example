They save fortune favors the bold, and The MUSE was born from that very spirit in the early 1800s. 

What started centuries ago as a small card room has grown into a brilliant house of chance, where every spin of the wheel and every flip of a card carries the promise of legend. The founders weren’t just gamblers — they were dreamers, chasing the idea that wealth could be won overnight if fate was kind enough. Every few years, roulette wheels and slot machines. During their thriving era, the founders fought through laws and boycotts that sought to silence them, yet in doing so, they expanded the landscape for daring dreamers. 

Step inside, and you’re not just entering a casino — you become part of a story written by winners, dreamers, and the bold spirits that made The MUSE what it is today.
